      <h1>The Future of Renewable Energy: Innovations and Challenges</h1>
      <img src="img/article-2.jpg" alt="Climate Change" />
      <p>
        As global temperatures rise and weather patterns become increasingly
        unpredictable, agriculture faces one of its biggest challenges in
        history. Climate change has already caused shifts in crop yields, with
        many regions experiencing reduced productivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prolonged droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall have disrupted planting
        and harvesting cycles. Farmers are being forced to adapt by exploring
        resilient crop varieties, implementing advanced irrigation systems, and
        adopting sustainable practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Governmental policies are also evolving, with incentives for sustainable
        farming and investment in renewable energy sources for agricultural
        operations. However, developing nations face significant hurdles due to
        lack of resources and technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        The United Nations emphasizes the need for collective action to mitigate
        the long-term effects of climate change on food security. Scientists are
        optimistic that with collaboration, humanity can rise to this challenge
        and build a sustainable agricultural future.
      </p>
