      <p>
        Plastic pollution has reached alarming levels, with over 300 million
        tons of plastic waste generated annually. Oceans, rivers, and landscapes
        are littered with non-biodegradable materials, threatening ecosystems
        worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countries are taking action with measures like single-use plastic bans,
        incentives for recycling, and education campaigns. The European Union
        recently passed directives restricting the use of common plastic
        products, such as straws and cutlery, while nations like Kenya imposed
        heavy penalties for plastic bag usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Innovative recycling technologies are also playing a significant role.
        Startups and large corporations alike are turning waste into valuable
        resources like building materials and fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plastic crisis underscores the importance of collective
        responsibility. Every effort counts, from individuals reducing personal
        plastic consumption to governments enforcing stricter environmental
        policies.
