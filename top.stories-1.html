      <h1>The Future of Artificial Intelligence: What to Expect</h1>
      <img src="img/featured-1.jpg" alt="AI Image" />
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved in the past decade,
        influencing every sector from healthcare to entertainment. While we see
        advancements such as self-driving cars and AI-assisted medical
        diagnoses, the future holds even more potential breakthroughs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the coming years, AI is expected to deeply integrate into industries,
        providing faster problem-solving capabilities and automating routine
        tasks. Concepts like general AI, which can perform any intellectual task
        like a human, are gaining traction in research laboratories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, ethical AI is a growing topic. Developers are focusing on
        creating AI systems that respect privacy and reduce biases, ensuring
        they remain trustworthy. As AI continues to grow, itâ€™s clear that human
        oversight will be vital in shaping its path.
      </p>
      <p>
        From augmented creativity tools for artists to personalized learning
        systems for students, AI is poised to improve human potential in new
        ways.
